# embedded-sfa3x

Embedded I2C and UART drivers for the Sensirion sfa3x sensor.
The I2C driver can be found in the `i2c` directory and the UART driver in
the `uart` directory.

These drivers are not meant to be used at the same time.

To compile the example usage of the drivers follow the instructions in the
README file in the corresponding folder:
 * [./i2c/README.md](i2c/README.md)
 * [./uart/README.md](uart/README.md)
